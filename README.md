Music Recommendation System
Context
In today's digital age, music streaming services face the challenge of keeping users engaged amidst an ever-growing library of content. An effective recommendation system is crucial for maintaining user interest and justifying subscription costs, directly impacting company revenue.
Objective
To enhance user experience by developing a system that accurately predicts and recommends the top 10 songs a user is most likely to enjoy.
Dataset

Source: Echo Nest Taste Profile Subset from the Million Song Dataset
Files:

Song data: song_id, title, release, artist_name, year
User interaction data: user_id, song_id, play_count



Approach
We implemented and compared various collaborative filtering techniques:

Popularity-Based Recommendation
User-User Collaborative Filtering
Item-Item Collaborative Filtering
Matrix Factorization (SVD)
Clustering-Based Recommendation
Content-Based Recommendation

Key Findings

Strong positive bias in the dataset, with an average rating of 4.29 and 75% of ratings being 4 stars or higher.
Explosive growth in music content since 1990, emphasizing the need for robust recommendation systems.
Matrix Factorization (SVD) emerged as the best-performing model, balancing accuracy and relevance in recommendations.

Model Performance

SVD (optimized):

RMSE: 1.0224
Precision: 0.405
Recall: 0.55
F1 Score: 0.466



Insights

The SVD model demonstrated a nuanced approach, balancing popularity with personalization.
It successfully uncovered potentially appealing tracks that might be overlooked by purely popularity-based systems.
The model showed an ability to capture subtle user preferences, resulting in diverse recommendations.

Future Work

Incorporate audio features and metadata to create more nuanced recommendations.
Explore ensemble methods, combining global patterns from SVD with local patterns from clustering.
Investigate the impact of recency on song popularity and user preferences.

Conclusion
This project highlights the complexity of music recommendation in the face of content explosion. It demonstrates the power of collaborative filtering techniques, particularly matrix factorization, in providing personalized and diverse recommendations. The findings underscore the importance of balancing accuracy, diversity, and user exploration in modern music recommendation systems.
